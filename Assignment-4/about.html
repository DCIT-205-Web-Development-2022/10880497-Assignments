                I am an 18 year old living in Accra, Ghana. I am currently an undergraduate student in the University of Ghana studying Information Technology. I am a developer and I like to solve problems using technology. I am proficient in languages like HTML, CSS/Sass/Bootstrap CSS, Javascript, Python, Java and C/C++. I also recently started learning React JS and NodeJS. I would like to become a software engineer in the near future.

                Outside of I.T, I am a pianist and composer and I have been playing the piano for about 4 years. I studied art music for 3 years and I compose music for choirs, solo instruments and sometimes symphony orchestra. I have also learnt how to play by ear in my time of learning the instrument. As a composer, I have a very wide range of music taste. I listen to classical music, jazz music, baroque music, reggae music, pop music, rap music and many others but I fancy reggae the most.

                I also write poetry and play basketball. I am currently competing in the inter-hall games for my hall, Dr. Hilla Limann. I started basketball about 4 years ago however I stopped to focus on studies but now I have picked it back up. I am a poet and I have many poems for personal and professional purposes. Currently, since I am focusing on my career as a soffware engineer, I have resorted to writing poetry and reading in my free time.
