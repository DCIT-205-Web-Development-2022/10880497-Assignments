                    <p>
                        I am an 18 year old living in Accra, Ghana. I am currently an undergraduate student in the University of Ghana studying Information Technology. I am a developer and I like to solve problems using technology.  
                        I am proficient in languages like HTML, CSS/Sass/Bootstrap CSS, Javascript, Python, Java and C/C++. I also recently started learning 
                        React JS and NodeJS. I would like to become a software engineer in the near future.  
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Outside of I.T, I am a pianist and composer and I have been playing the piano for about 4 years. I studied art music for 3 years and I compose music 
                        for choirs, solo instruments and sometimes symphony orchestra. I have also learnt how to play by ear in my time of learning
                        the instrument. As a composer, I have a very wide range of music taste. I listen to classical music, jazz music, baroque
                        music, reggae music, pop music, rap music and many others but I fancy reggae the most.
                    </p>       
                    <p>
                        I also write poetry and play basketball. I am currently competing in the inter-hall games for my hall, Dr. Hilla Limann. 
                        I started basketball about 4 years ago however I stopped to focus on studies but now I have picked it back up. I am a poet and 
                        I have many poems for personal and professional purposes. Currently, since I am focusing on my career as a soffware 
                        engineer, I have resorted to writing poetry and reading in my free time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I intend on becoming very influential and the statements that help me learn something everyday is <strong>Hardwork, persistence and consistency gets you noticed</strong>
                        and <strong>Never fancy yourself better than anyone. Learn from people and teach people where necessary</strong>
                    </p>
